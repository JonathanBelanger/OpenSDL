@unnumbered Preface

This manual describes the Open Structure Definition Language (OpenSDL) and the
OpenSDL translator for use on any compatible operating systems.  OpenSDL source
code can be translated to output files in one or more target programming
languages.  OpenSDL is suitable for systems and application programming
environments that use executable programs consisting of modules written in one
or multiple programming languages.

@unnumberedsec Intended Audience

This manual is intended for users who are familiar with one or more programming
languages and who are currently involved in the design and development of
multilanguage programming applications; however, users are not required to have
previous experience with OpenSDL in order to use this manual.

@comment Chapert 1 --- Overview
@node Overview
@chapter Overview

The Open Structure Definition Language (OpenSDL) is used to write source
statements that describe data structures and that can be translated to source
statements in other languages.  You can include the resulting output files in a
corresponding target language program for subsequent compilation.
@cindex Data structures
@cindex Output files

Because OpenSDL is compiler- and language-independent, it is particularly
useful for maintaining multilanguage implementations.  For example, you can
create and later modify a single OpenSDL source file that can be translated to
multilanguage output files; any number of these output files can then be
included in one or several multilanguage programming applications.
@cindex Output files

OpenSDL supports the following OpenVMS language:
@itemize @bullet
@item C/C++
@end itemize

@section The OpenSDL Translation Process
@cindex OpenSDL translation process
The translation of an OpenSDL source file occurs when you issue the OpenSDL
command (@ref{Processing an OpenSDL Source File}).  The OpenSDL command
activates the OpenSDL ``front-end'' translator (@file{OpenSDL.exe}), which is
stored in the @file{/usr/bin} directory/folder.  The front end parses the
OpenSDL source code and, if you specify the @command{--lang} qualifier, passes
the parsed data to one or more of the OpenSDL ``back-end'' translators.  The
following table is a list of the back-ends that are stored in the
@file(/usr/bin) directory/folder>
@cindex Command line qualifiers

@float Table, OpenSDL Back-ends
@multitable @columnfractions .1 .3 .3 .3
@headitem Language @tab Cygwin @tab Windows @tab Linux
@item C/C++ @tab cygOpenSDL_c.dll @tab OpenSDL_c.dll @tab libOpenSDL_c.so
@end multitable
@caption{OpenSDL Back-ends}
@end float

@quotation Note
The environment variable @command{SDL_SHARED_LIBRARY_PATH} can be defined to
have OpenSDL look in this directory/folder for the language back-ends.
@end quotation

Each back end translates only those OpenSDL declarations that can (or need) be
expressed in that language.  OpenSDL declarations, described in detail in
@ref{Declarations}, translate to the following types of data items:
@cindex Declarations
@cindex OpenSDL declarations

@itemize @bullet
@item Scalar or dimensioned scalar data items (@code{ITEM} declarations)
@item Non-scalar data items (@code{AGGREGATE} and subaggregate declarations)
@item Named constants (@code{CONSTANT} declarations)
@item External entries(@code{ENTRY} declarations)
@end itemize
@cindex AGGREGATE keyword
@cindex Arrays
@cindex CONSTANT keyword
@cindex ENTRY keyword
@cindex ITEM keyword
@cindex Scalar items
@cindex Subaggregate declaration

@ref{OpenSDL Translation Process} shows each step in the OpenSDL translation
process, and the key following the example describes each step.
@ref{Processing an OpenSDL Source File} describes the OpenSDL command in
detail.

@float Figure, OpenSDL Translation Process

@enumerate
@item Create a properly formatted OpenSDL file (@file{.sdl}) containing a 
@code{MODULE} and @code{END_MODULE}, and one or more @code{CONSTANT},

noting any errors that may be reported.

@item If errors are reported, then open the file in your favorite text editor
and make corrections as appropriate.  Then go back to step 2.

@item Verify that the resulting output file(s) contain the definitions
expected.  If not, then make corrections and reprocess the file.

Key to @ref{OpenSDL Translation Process}:
@enumerate

@item The front end (@file{OpenSDL.exe}) parses the statements contained in the
OpenSDL source file test.sdl as a result of issuing the OpenSDL command in the
following way:

@enumerate a
@item @command{$ OpenSDL --lang=c test.sdl}@*
If you specify the @command{--lang} qualifier (for example,
@command{--lang:cc}), the front end parses the source code and passes the
parsed data to the back end for the specified language.
@end enumerate
@cindex Command line qualifiers

@item The specified back end (@command{c}) produces an output file with the
default file type of @file{.h}.
@end enumerate

You can specify any or all of the language options on the @command{--lang}
qualifier, and OpenSDL produces separate output files for each language
specified.

@cindex Language options
@cindex Output files

@section Description of a Sample OpenSDL Source File

@ref{Sample OpenSDL Source File} is a typical OpenSDL source file, and the key
following the example describes each of the numbered language elements.
(@ref{Elements} describes all the language elements in detail.)  You may want
to familiarize yourself with this example because it shows the source file you
will be creating in the tutorial in @ref{Getting Started with OpenSDL}.

@cindex Local symbols

@item @code{CONSTANT} declarations produce declarations of named constants.
When the @code{INCREMENT} option and an increment value are specified, OpenSDL
automatically increments the initial value for each of the declared output

@chapter Creating, Editing, and Processing an OpenSDL Source File

This chapter describes how to create an OpenSDL source file using a basic
text editor (Notepad++) and how to process your source file using the OpenSDL
command and its qualifiers.

You can use any text editor to create your source file.

@ref{Entering Source Code} describes how to use a text editor to enter OpenSDL
source code.  @ref{Getting Started with OpenSDL} provides a tutorial to get you
started using a text editor to write OpenSDL source code.  @ref{Compiling

@node Entering Source Code
@subsection Entering Source Code

This section provides basic information about entering OpenSDL formatter code
into a text editor.

The parser for OpenSDl ignores most whitespace characters, including @key{SP},
@key{TAB}, and @key{ENTER}.  Therefore, these characters can be used to
structure the file for easier understanding.

The OpenSDL keywords are not case sensitive.  As such, they can be enter as all
uppercase, all lowercase, or mixed (camel) case.

The identifiers associated with various OpenSDL keywords are case sensitive,
depending upon the output language.  Within the OpenSDL parser, a lowercase
@code{AGGREGATE} @emph{ID} will @strong{not} match an uppercase (or camelcase)
@code{END} @emph{ID}, and will cause a warning message to be displayed.
@cindex AGGREGATE keyword
@cindex END keyword
@cindex Identifiers, user specified

Identifiers that are also an OpenSDL keyword can be used, but need to be
enclosed in double-quotes (@key{"}).  Any leading and trailing spaces will be
ignored.

@enumerate
@item Type @code{MODULE opr_descriptor IDENT "Version 2.0";} on the first
line of the OpenSDL file we are creating, then hit the @key{Enter} key.

The @code{opr_descriptor}, will be used when generating files where the file
should only be included a single time to prevent a file from being included
multiple times.  When used in this way, the string written to the
@emph{identifier} will be converted to all uppercase and an underscore @key{_}
will be added to the beginning and end of the upcased string.

The value after the @code{IDENT} keyword must always be enclosed in
double-quote characters (@key{"}).  Your screen will look as follows:

This line contains one of the three comment formats.  Comments starting with a
brace (@key{@{} will @strong{not} be written to the output file.  Comments
starting with a forward-slash followed by an asterics @key{/*} will be written
to the output file as a line comment formatted for the output language.  The
third comment fornat is the block comment, see for more information about
comments in the OpenSDL language in sections @ref{Local Comments} and

@node Compiling Source Code
@subsection Compiling Source Code
@cindex Compiling source code

Compiling source code is very straightforward.  You use the command qualifiers
to read in the input file and generate one or more output files.  At a minimum
the command line consists of the following:
@cindex Output files

@enumerate
@item The @command{OpenSDL} command.
@item One output language (e.g. @command{--lang:c}).
@item The input file @file{test.sdl}. 
@end enumerate
@cindex Command line qualifiers

When compiling an input file, as errors are detected, the are displayed to
stderr.  Additionally, the @command{--list} qualifier can be specified to
generate a listing file, where the same errors will be displayed at the line
where the error was detected.
@cindex Command line qualifiers
@cindex --list qualifier
@cindex Listing generation

@quotation Note
The line numbers displayed within the error message text may not be exactly the
line of code in a listing file where the message will be written.  The error
message text will refer to the first line of a multi-line statement, where this
same text will be written immediately after the line of code that actually
caused the condition to be detected.

A single line of code can generate multiple errors, the errors will be
displayed in the order in which they were detected.

@node Processing an OpenSDL Source File
@section Processing an OpenSDL Source File
@cindex Processing a source file

The @command{OpenSDL} command invokes the OpenSDL translator from the command
line to produce output files for one or more target languages.  The
@command{OpenSDL} command has the following format:

@command{$ OpenSDL [qualifier[...]] file-spec [qualifier[...]]}
@cindex Command line qualifiers

@subsubheading Command Parameter

@strong{@file{file-spec}}
@indentedblock

@ref{Declarations}:
@cindex Declarations
@cindex OpenSDL declarations

@itemize @bullet
@item User-specified names, which can be either local symbol names or source
program identifiers
@item Reserved OpenSDL keywords
@item Expressions
@end itemize
@cindex Identifiers, user specified

The following can also be used within a @code{MODULE} declaration; although
they are not OpenSDL language elements (@ref{Local Comments} through
@ref{INCLUDE Statement}):
@cindex INCLUDE statement
@cindex Local comments

@itemize @bullet
@item Local and output, line and block, comments

The space, tab, or carriage return character delimits the language elements,
and a semicolon (;) terminates each declaration.  In @code{MODULE} and
@code{AGGREGATE} declarations, the semicolon also terminates separate parts of
the declaration.
@cindex AGGREGATE keyword

@ref{Summaries} shows language translation summaries of all the OpenSDL

@node Names
@section Names

An OpenSDL name can be either a user-specified local symbol name that is not
translated to the output file or a user-specified source program identifier
that is translated to the output file.  Names are composed of upper- and
lowercase letters (A-Z, a-z), numbers (0-9), the dollar sign ($), and the
underscore (_).  Specifying a name is subject to the following rules:
@cindex Local symbol

@quotation Note
The use of the dollar sign ($) in symbol names is not supported by all
languages or compilers.  As a result, its use may cause compiler or portability
issues.  It's use is discouraged.  It is supported for backward compatibility
with OpenVMS versions of the software.
@end quotation

@enumerate
@item Local symbol names must begin with a pound sign (#).
@item Source program identifiers must begin with an alphabetic character
(A-Z, a-z), a dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_).
@cindex Identifiers, user specified
@item Source program identifiers that are reserved OpenSDL keywords or that
contain invalid  OpenSDL characters must be enclosed in quotation marks (" ").

@end enumerate

@node Local Symbol Names
@subsection Local Symbol Names
A local symbol name is known only within an OpenSDL source file and cannot be
translated directly to the output file.  A local symbol name can be assigned a
value anywhere within a source file, but must begin with the pound sign (#).
A local symbol is declared when it is first assigned a value.  This value can
be any valid expression (@ref{Expressions}).  If you reference a local symbol
before assigning it a value, OpenSDL displays an error message and does not
produce an output file.  A local symbol assignment has the following syntax:
@cindex Local symbols

@example
#local-name = expression;
@end example

@strong{@code{#local-name}} is any valid OpenSDL name.

@strong{@code{expression}} is any valid OpenSDL expression resulting in a
quadword integer value.  Signed integer quadword data types are described in
@ref{Integer Data Types}.  The following are examples of local symbol
assignments:

@example
#max_args = 255;
#counter = #counter + 1;
@end example

The values of these local symbols may be referenced by subsequent declarations,
as shown in the following example:

@example
CONSTANT block_node_size EQUALS #max_args + #counter;
@end example
@cindex Local symbols example

@subsection Source Program Identifiers

Source program identifiers (identifiers) specify declaration names,
@code{AGGREGATE} member names, and @code{ENTRY} parameter names that are passed
to the output file.  Optional user-specified prefixes and tags can be appended
to these identifiers.  If a prefix is specified without a tag, OpenSDL
concatenates a default tag (corresponding to the data type) to the identifier
in the output file.  (@ref{PREFIX MARKER and TAG Keywords} describes the
@code{PREFIX}. @code{MARKER} and @code{TAG} keyword options.) The identifier
@code{block_node_size} in the following example names the @code{CONSTANT}
declaration:
@cindex AGGREGATE keyword
@cindex AGGREGATE member
@cindex CONSTANT keyword
@cindex Data type, tag
@cindex ENTRY keyword
@cindex EQUALS keyword
@cindex Identifiers, user specified
@cindex MARKER keyword
@cindex PREFIX keyword
@cindex TAG keyword

@example
CONSTANT block_node_size EQUALS #max_args + #counter;
@end example
@cindex CONSTANT example
@cindex EQUALS example

To avoid compilation errors, each reference to a particular OpenSDL identifier
must be a case sensitive match because an identifier is passed to the output
file in the same case in which it appears in the source file.  You can use
reserved OpenSDL keywords and characters that are not valid in identifiers if
you enclose them in quotation marks (" ").  For example:
@cindex Identifiers, OpenSDL keywords

@example
ITEM "length" LONGWORD;
@end example
@cindex ITEM example

This declaration produces the identifier length, which is a reserved OpenSDL
keyword typically used to specify the length of a bit-string or
character-string data type (see @ref{BITFIELD Data Type} and
@ref{CHARACTER Data Type}).

@subsubsection User-Specified TYPENAME keyword

@quotation Note
The @code{TYPENAME} keyword is part of the original SDL language format.  This
particular implementation foes not currently support either the Ada or PL/I
languages.  As a result, this keyword is parsed but ignored in the current
implementation.
@end quotation
@cindex User specified names
@cindex TYPENAME keyword

The @code{TYPENAME} keyword is used to specify a data type name that is not an
OpenSDL data type.  Depending on which back end is specified, this name may or
may not override the OpenSDL data type.  The Ada and PL/I back ends use these
data type names as parameter data types, as return value data types, and as
@code{CONSTANT} declaration data types.
@cindex CONSTANT declaration
@cindex Data type, TYPENAME
@cindex TYPENAME keyword

The @code{TYPENAME} keyword has the following syntax:

@example
TYPENAME name
@end example
@cindex TYPENAME example

The Ada language translation (as a result of processing the OpenSDL source file
@file{/usr/lib/OpenSDL/example/example.sdl}) shows an example of the
@code{TYPENAME} keyword.  The following is an example of the @code{TYPENAME}
keyword on each of the parameters in an @code{ENTRY} declaration:

@example
ENTRY SYS$FAO
    ALIAS $FAO
    PARAMETER (CHARACTER REFERENCE NAMED CTRSTR IN TYPENAME CHARDESC,
        WORD UNSIGNED NAMED OUTLEN OUT DEFAULT 0 TYPENAME NUMBER,

@node PREFIX MARKER and TAG Keywords
@subsubsection PREFIX, MARKER, and TAG Keywords
@cindex MARKER keyword
@cindex PREFIX keyword
@cindex TAG keyword

User-defined prefixes, markers, and tags are optional character strings that
help to uniquely identify the names associated with a particular facility or
system.  When the @command{--suppress} qualifier is specified on the command
line, the inclusion of prefixes and/or tags on output symbol names is
suppressed.  See @ref{Processing an OpenSDL Source File} for a description of
the @command{--suppress} qualifier.
@cindex Command line qualifiers

@subsubheading PREFIX Keyword

The @code{PREFIX} option may be specified on an @code{AGGREGATE}, subaggregate,
@code{CONSTANT}, or @code{ITEM} declaration to cause OpenSDL to concatenate a
user-specified prefix and the name specified in the declaration.
@cindex AGGREGATE keyword
@cindex AGGREGATE declaration
@cindex CONSTANT keyword
@cindex CONSTANT declaration
@cindex ITEM keyword
@cindex ITEM declaration
@cindex PREFIX keyword
@cindex Subaggregate declaration

When you specify a prefix for an aggregate, OpenSDL concatenates the prefix and
the name of each member or named constant declared within the aggregate.  The
name of the aggregate itself is not altered by the use of the @code{PREFIX}
option.  The @code{PREFIX} option has the following syntax:
@cindex AGGREGATE member
@cindex Named constants
@cindex PREFIX keyword

@example
PREFIX prefix-string
@end example

@strong{prefix-string}
@indentedblock
Is a 0 to 32-character string that can be any valid OpenSDL identifier.
If you specify the @code{PREFIX} option, OpenSDL constructs the identifier of
each member by concatenating the prefix, a tag, an underscore, and the member
name.
@end indentedblock

You can override a prefix that is currently in effect by specifying a new
prefix for a particular aggregate member.  If this member happens to be a
subaggregate, the new prefix is applied to all the members of that
subaggregate.  Otherwise, if no prefix is specified for the subaggregate, all
subaggregate members are assigned the same prefix as that specified on the
parent aggregate.
@cindex Subaggregate declaration

@subsubheading MARKER Keyword
@cindex MARKER keyword

You can use the @code{MARKER} keyword to assign a user-defined prefix to the
aggregate name.  The @code{MARKER} option has the following syntax:

@example
MARKER marker-string
@end example

@strong{marker-string}
@indentedblock
Is a 0 to 32-character string that can be any valid OpenSDL name that may or
may not be enclosed in quotation marks (" ") and may be null.
@end indentedblock

@subsubheading TAG Keyword

The @code{TAG} option overrides the default tags that OpenSDL uses in forming
identifiers.  You can specify tags for @code{CONSTANT}, @code{ITEM}, and
@code{AGGREGATE} declarations and aggregate members.  The tag that you specify,
however, affects only the outer-level identifier.  For example, a tag you
supply in an @code{AGGREGATE} declaration affects only the aggregate name; if
you wish to change all the tags in an aggregate, you must do it on a
member-by-member basis.  The @code{TAG} option has the following syntax:
@cindex AGGREGATE keyword
@cindex AGGREGATE declaration
@cindex AGGREGATE member
@cindex CONSTANT keyword
@cindex CONSTANT declaration
@cindex Identifiers, OpenSDL generated
@cindex ITEM keyword
@cindex ITEM declaration
@cindex TAG keyword

@example
TAG tag-string
@end example

@strong{tag-string}
@indentedblock
Is a 0 to 32-character string specifying the tag to use in forming the name.
If the TAG option is not specified, OpenSDL uses a default code based on the
data type of the name.
@end indentedblock
@cindex Data type, tag
@cindex TAG keyword

If you specify the @code{TAG} option, OpenSDL appends the tag-string, which may
be null (" "), and an underscore character (_) to the current prefix-string.  A
tag consisting of a single underscore character produces a single underscore
character in any resulting identifier.
@cindex TAG keyword

The following is an example of the @code{PREFIX}, @code{TAG}, and @code{MARKER}
keywords:

@float Example, PREFIX, MARKER, and TAG Example
@example
AGGREGATE operator STRUCTURE MARKER doowop_ PREFIX beebop_ TAG shoo;
    flink ADDRESS;
    blink WORD;
END;
@end example
@cindex ADDRESS keyword
@cindex ADDRESS example

@cindex AGGREGATE declaration
@cindex AGGREGATE example
@cindex END keyword
@cindex MARKER example
@cindex PREFIX example
@cindex STRUCTURE example
@cindex TAG example

The resulting output using the C/C++ backend is as follows:

@example
struct doowop_shoo_operator
@{
    void *beebop_a_flink;
    void *beebop_a_blink;
@};
@end example

The following example shows the use of a user-specified prefix on an
@code{AGGREGATE} declaration:
@cindex AGGREGATE keyword
@cindex AGGREGATE declaration

@float Example, PREFIX on AGGREGATE Example
@example
AGGREGATE operator STRUCTURE
    PREFIX opr_;
    id WORD;
    "typename" CHARACTER;
    CONSTANT (fixed_bin_,float_) EQUALS 0 INCREMENT 1;
    bits STRUCTURE;
        variable_size BITFIELD;
        size_units BITFIELD LENGTH 3;
    END bits;
END operator;
@end example
@caption{PREFIX on AGGREGATE Example}

@cindex CHARACTER example
@cindex CONSTANT example
@cindex END keyword
@cindex EQUALS example
@cindex INCREMENT example
@cindex LENGTH example
@cindex PREFIX keyword

In the previous example, the member name @code{"typename"} is enclosed in
quotation marks because it is an OpenSDL keyword.

The previous declaration produces the
following names, with the prefix opr_ and default tags, in the C/C++ output
file:

@float Example, PREFIX on AGGREGATE C/C++ Output
@example
#define opr_k_fixed_bin_	0
#define opr_k_float_		1
#define opr_s_operator		4	/* not sure if I generate this */
struct opr_r_operator
@{
    int16_t opr_w_id;
    char opr_t_typename;
    struct opr_r_bits
    @{
        uint8_t opr_v_variable_size : 1;
      	uint8_t opr_v_size_units : 3;
      	uint8_t opr_v_fill_0 :4;
    @};
@};
@end example
@caption{PREFIX on AGGREGATE C/C++ Output}
@end float

The name opr_v_fill_0 in the previous list is the result of a @code{BITFIELD}
declaration that OpenSDL supplied because the subaggregate did not end on a
byte boundary.  The name (opr_v_fill_0) ensures that the next aggregate begins
on a byte boundary.  @ref{Forcing Data Alignment} describes data alignment in
detail.  OpenSDL uses default codes followed by an underscore (_) for the tag
portion of a prefix when the TAG option is not specified.  You can override the
default OpenSDL codes by specifying a tag, which may be null ("").  For
example:
@cindex Alignment
@cindex BITFIELD declaration
@cindex Forcing data alignment
@cindex Subaggregate declaration
@cindex TAG keyword

@example
CONSTANT (abc,def,ghi) EQUALS 0 INCREMENT 1
    PREFIX new
    TAG "";
@end example
@cindex CONSTANT example
@cindex EQUALS example
@cindex INCREMENT example
@cindex PREFIX example
@cindex TAG example

This declaration results in the names @code{new_abc}, @code{new_def}, and
@code{new_ghi}.

@node RADIX Keyword
@subsubsection RADIX Keyword
The RADIX keyword can be used to indicate how a constant value should
be written out to the output file.  It can have one of three possible values.

will generate the following C code header file:

@example
#define MyConst 0x2a

@node Alignment Keywords
@subsubsection Alignment Keywords
@cindex Alignment
@cindex Alignment keywords
@cindex ALIGN keyword
Both the @code{ALIGN} and @code{BASEALIGN} keywords can ensure that items are
properly aligned.  The @code{BASEALIGN} keyword takes an argument, which
specifies the alignment, whereas the @code{ALIGN} keyword uses the natural
alignment of the item.
@cindex BASEALIGN keyword

@itemize @bullet
@item If the @code{ALIGN} keyword is included in the definition of an
aggregate, every member will be aligned.  Both @code{i1} and @code{i2} will be
aligned.
@example
AGGREGATE MyStruct STRUCTURE ALIGN;
    c1 CHARACTER;
    i1 LONGWORD;
    c2 CHARACTER;

an aggregate, this member will be aligned, even if the @code{AGGREGATE} itself
does not have the @code{ALIGN} attribute.  @code{i2} will be aligned whereas
@code{i1} will not be aligned.
@example
AGGREGATE MyStruct STRUCTURE NOALIGN;

@code{i2} will be aligned, @code{i1} will not be aligned.

@item If the @code{BASEALIGN} keyword is included in the definition of a member
of an aggregate, this member will be aligned according to the given alignment.
In this case, @code{i2} will have an offset of 256 (@math{2@sup{8}}),
@example
AGGREGATE MyStruct STRUCTURE NOALIGN;
    c CHARACTER;
    i1 LONGWORD;

@item If the @code{BASEALIGN} keyword is included in the definition of an
aggregate or an item, the aggregate or item itself will be padded, so that in
an array of elements of this aggregate or item type, all elements will be
aligned according to the given alignment.  The syntax is as follows:
@example
AGGREGATE MyStruct STRUCTURE BASEALIGN (2);
    c CHARACTER;

The size of the aggregate will be a multiple of 4 (@math{2@sum{2}}), in this
case 12, and neither @code{i1} nor @code{i2} will be aligned.  In the following
example, the item will have a size of 8 (@math{2@sup{3}}).

@node Storage Class Keywords
@subsubsection Storage Class Keywords
@cindex Storage classes

Storage class refers to the way in which the target language compiler allocates
storage for scalar items and aggregates.  In general, declarations produce a
template describing data for which the compiler allocates storage dynamically
at run time, rather than at compile time.  This type of storage is the default
and is specified using the @code{BASED} option in some languages, although the
default storage class option is language-dependent.  The back end can
generate the @code{BASED} storage class option, which has the following
syntax:
@cindex Default storage class
@cindex Scalar items

@example
BASED (pointer-name)
@end example
@cindex BASED keyword
@cindex BASED storage class

In languages that support the construct, you can use the @code{BASED}
pointer-name option on an @code{AGGREGATE} declaration to bind a named pointer
to that aggregate.  In all target languages, the aggregate resulting from such
a declaration has the default storage class (@code{BASED}).
@cindex AGGREGATE keyword
@cindex AGGREGATE declaration
@cindex Default storage class
@cindex Storage classes

A subaggregate always acquires the storage class of the aggregate to which it
belongs.  The default storage class associated with any declaration is
language-dependent.  You can override the default storage class by specifying
either of the following storage classes:
@cindex Default storage class
@cindex Storage classes
@cindex Subaggregate declaration

@itemize @bullet
@item @strong{Common storage} is allocated in an external program section
(Psect) with the OVR option and is shared by all routines that reference it.
You declare data in common storage by using the @code{COMMON} option on an
@code{AGGREGATE} or @code{ITEM} declaration.
@cindex AGGREGATE keyword
@cindex AGGREGATE declaration
@cindex COMMON keyword
@cindex COMMON storage class
@cindex ITEM keyword
@cindex ITEM declaration
@cindex OVR option
@cindex Psect

@item @strong{Global storage} represents data in a global storage location
whose value is defined elsewhere.  You declare global data by using the
@code{GLOBAL} option on an @code{AGGREGATE} or @code{ITEM} declaration.
@cindex AGGREGATE keyword
@cindex AGGREGATE declaration
@cindex GLOBAL storage class
@cindex ITEM keyword
@cindex ITEM declaration

@item @strong{TYPEDEF} behaves like a storage class.  In C/C++, examples of
storage classes are @code{static}, @code{globaldef/ref}, @code{extern}, etc.
Syntactically, you can replace a @code{static} in any declaration with
@code{typedef} and have it compiled.  Storage classes (including
@code{TYPEDEF}) are mutually exclusive in an OpenSDL declaration.
@cindex OpenSDL declarations
@cindex Storage classes
@cindex TYPEDEF storage class

Example of C/C++ type definition:
@example
typedef struct @{int32_t jg_l_i1; int32_t j_l_i2;@} MyStruct;
static MyStruct foo;
@end example
is equivalent to:
@example
static struct @{int32_t jg_l_i1; int32_t jg_l_i2;@} foo;
@end example
or:
@example
static struct MyStruct @{int32_t jg_l_i1; int32_t jg_l_i2;@} foo;
@end example
or:
@example
struct MyStruct @{int32_t jg_l_i1; int32_t jg_l_i2;@};
static struct MyStruct foo;
@end example
@end itemize

If @code{COMMON} and @code{GLOBAL} appear together in a declaration, a
@code{SDL_DUPCONATT} (duplicate or conflicting attributes) error is given.  The
@code{COMMON}, @code{GLOBAL} and @code{TYPEDEF} storage classes are mutually
exclusive.
@cindex COMMON keyword
@cindex COMMON declaration
@cindex TYPEDEF keyword
@cindex TYPEDEF declaration

@subsubsection OpenSDL Storage Classes and Typedef Syntax
Explicit OpenSDL Storage classes are @code{COMMON} and @code{GLOBAL}.  To
maintain orthogonal syntax, @code{TYPEDEF} is permitted wherever @code{COMMON}
and @code{GLOBAL} are permitted.
@cindex COMMON storage class
@cindex Storage classes
@cindex TYPEDEF storage class

The Storage class definition in OpenSDL is included as an option on an
@code{ITEM} or @code{AGGREGATE} declaration.  This means that an
@code{AGGREGATE TYPEDEF} for the preceding example would be:
@cindex AGGREGATE keyword
@cindex AGGREGATE declaration
@cindex ITEM keyword
@cindex ITEM declaration
@cindex Storage classes
@cindex TYPEDEF keyword


@example

    i2 LONGWORD;
END;
@end example
@cindex AGGREGATE example
@cindex END keyword
@cindex PREFIX example

@subsubsection Data Types
In most cases it is possible to refer to a user-defined Data Type where a
standard built-in OpenSDL Data Type (BYTE, LONGWORD etc.) can be referenced.
Reference to the type MyStruct defined in the preceding example is made as
follows:
@cindex BYTE keyword
@cindex Data type, user defined
@cindex Data type, TYPEDEF
@cindex TYPEDEF keyword

@node DIMENSION Keyword
@subsubsection DIMENSION Keyword
@cindex DIMENSION keyword

You can apply a dimension to @code{AGGREGATE} (as well as members of aggregates
and subaggregates) and @code{ITEM} declarations, which means that you can
define an array of structures, a structure that contains one or more arrays, or
an array of structures each of which contains one or more arrays.  The
@code{DIMENSION} option is valid when specified with any of the data types
described in @ref{Data Type Keywords} and has the following syntax:
@cindex AGGREGATE keyword
@cindex AGGREGATE declaration
@cindex AGGREGATE member
@cindex Arrays
@cindex ITEM keyword
@cindex ITEM declaration
@cindex Subaggregate declaration

@example
DIMENSION [lbound:]hbound
@end example

@strong{@code{lbound}}
@indentedblock
Is any valid OpenSDL expression giving the value of the lowest-numbered element
of the array.  If lbound is not specified, OpenSDL supplies a default
@code{lbound} of 1.
@end indentedblock

@strong{@code{hbound}}
@indentedblock
Is any valid OpenSDL expression giving the number of elements in the array, or,
if @code{lbound} is specified, the highest-numbered element.
@end indentedblock

The following is an example of the @code{DIMENSION} option specified on an
@code{AGGREGATE} declaration:
@cindex AGGREGATE keyword

@example
AGGREGATE array_info STRUCTURE;
    bound STRUCTURE DIMENSION 8;
        lower LONGWORD;
        upper LONGWORD;
        multiplier LONGWORD;
        constant_lower BITFIELD LENGTH 1;
        constant_upper BITFIELD LENGTH 1;
        constant_multiplier BITFIELD LENGTH 1;
        reserved BITFIELD LENGTH 13;
    END bound;
END array_info;
@end example
@cindex AGGREGATE example
@cindex AGGREGATE member
@cindex BITFIELD example
@cindex CONSTANT example
@cindex DIMENSION example
@cindex END keyword
@cindex LENGTH example

The subaggregate bound has eight elements.  Each element consists of the members
upper, lower, multiplier, and so on.  Because bound is an array, each of its
members (upper, lower, multiplier, and so on) can also be considered an array
of eight elements.  When you specify a single value after the @code{DIMENSION}
keyword, as in the previous example, the specified back end assumes that the
value represents the high bound value and supplies a default low bound value of
one.  You can override this default by specifying both a low bound and a high
bound value as follows:
@cindex Subaggregate declaration

@example
ITEM node_pointers DIMENSION 0:255 ADDRESS;
@end example
@cindex ADDRESS example
@cindex DIMENSION example
@cindex ITEM example

This declaration results in a declaration of the array node_pointers, whose low
bound is 0 and whose high bound is 255.  Only one dimension can be specified for
an @code{AGGREGATE} or @code{ITEM} declaration.  This restriction ensures that
there is no interlanguage conflict in an array declaration.
@cindex AGGREGATE keyword
@cindex ITEM keyword

You can see how OpenSDL translates the @code{DIMENSION} option for each output
language by processing the OpenSDL source file
@file{/usr/lib/OpenSDL/examples/example.sdl}.

@node Data Type Keywords
@subsection Data Type Keywords

Data type keywords specify the data types of scalar objects, which can be
declared as members of aggregates or as individual items.  Data type keywords
are also used to describe the data types of parameters, as well as the return
value of an @code{ENTRY}.  They can also be used in an @code{AGGREGATE}
declaration to generate an implicit union.  The data type declaration also
specifies, either implicitly or explicitly, the size of a member.

Is a keyword specifying that OpenSDL generate both a bitfield variable and a
constant bit mask representing the bits defined in this field.
@end indentedblock
@cindex BITFIELD declaration
@cindex MASK keyword

@strong{@code{[SIGNED]}}
@indentedblock
Is a keyword specifying that OpenSDL treat the output as a signed field.
@end indentedblock

@strong{@code{[RADIX x]}}
@indentedblock
Is a keyword where 'x' is one of @code{DEC}, @code{OCT}, or @code{HEX}.
@end indentedblock

Bitfields must be @code{AGGREGATE} declaration members.  They cannot be scalar
items, objects of @code{ADDRESS} declarations, parameters, or return data types
of entries.  The following is an example of the @code{BITFIELD} keyword used in
an @code{AGGREGATE} declaration that specifies a structure with two bitfield
members:
@cindex AGGREGATE keyword
@cindex AGGREGATE declaration
@cindex AGGREGATE member
@cindex BITFIELD keyword
@cindex BITFIELD data type
@cindex BITFIELD declaration
@cindex Data type, BITFIELD
@cindex Scalar items

@example
AGGREGATE flags STRUCTURE PREFIX tst_;
    resolved BITFIELD MASK SIGNED;
    spare_bits BITFIELD LENGTH 5;
END;
@end example
@cindex AGGREGATE example
@cindex BITFIELD example
@cindex END keyword
@cindex LENGTH example
@cindex MASK example
@cindex PREFIX example

The declaration of resolved in the previous example results in two declarations
in the output file: a declaration for the bitfield itself and a declaration of
a constant mask whose value is 1.  Because the @code{PREFIX} option is
specified for this aggregate, the source output file identifiers produced for
this declaration are @code{tst_v_resolved} and @code{tst_m_resolved}, where the
tag @code{v_} indicates the bitfield variable and the tag @code{m_} indicates
the mask.  Prefixes and tags are described in more detail in
@ref{PREFIX MARKER and TAG Keywords}.
@cindex Identifiers, OpenSDL generated

@cindex TAG keyword

@subsubsection BOOLEAN Data Type

The @code{BOOLEAN} keyword specifies a Boolean data type that is a one-byte
field that can have one of two values, 0 or 1.  The @code{BOOLEAN} data type
has the following syntax:
@cindex BOOLEAN data type
@cindex Data type, BOOLEAN

@example
BOOLEAN
@end example

@strong{@code{BOOLEAN}}
@indentedblock

@node CHARACTER Data Type
@subsubsection CHARACTER Data Type
@cindex CHARACTER declarations
@cindex Data type, CHARACTER

The @code{CHARACTER} keyword declares a character string of a given length.
The @code{CHARACTER} data type has the following syntax:

@example
CHARACTER [LENGTH @{n@}] [VARYING]
          [       @{*@}]
@end example

@strong{@code{[LENGTH n]}}
@indentedblock
Is the length of the character string.  The length can be specified using any
valid OpenSDL expression.  If no length is specified, OpenSDL uses a default
length of 1 character.  You can specify a character string of unknown length
using @code{LENGTH *}.  An unknown length character string can be specified
only for parameter types.  For example:
@cindex LENGTH declaration

@example
ENTRY LIB$ROUTINE PARAMETER(CHARACTER LENGTH * NAMED foo);
@end example
@end indentedblock
@cindex CHARACTER example
@cindex ENTRY example
@cindex LENGTH example
@cindex NAMED example
@cindex PARAMETER example

@strong{@code{[VARYING]}}
@indentedblock
Is a keyword indicating that the identifier represents a varying-length
character string (for languages that support this data type).  In a
varying-length character string, the first word of the string contains its
current length; its declared length is the maximum length that it can have.
@end indentedblock

The following is an example of the @code{CHARACTER} data type used in an
@code{AGGREGATE} declaration.  The aggregate @code{msg_buffer} contains a
character-string member named @code{message_text} with a length of 256
characters.

@cindex Hexadecimal notation
@cindex Binary notation

OpenSDL treats decimal constants as signed integer longword values.
@cindex Decimal constants

You can also use a string of up to four characters as a numeric constant by
enclosing the string in quotation marks (" ").  OpenSDL inserts the ASCII
value of each character into the byte field corresponding to that character's
position in the string.  If the string you specify has fewer than four
characters, OpenSDL pads the string with the null character, which has the
ASCII code of zero.
@item Local symbols and output constants are assigned integer longword values
that are available within the context (that is, during processing) of the input
file.

@subsection Block Comments
@cindex Block comments

Block comments are those that appear as a large multi-line comment and are
written to the output file as multiple comment lines.

Block comments begin with a slash and a plus sign (@code{/+}) and end with a
slash and a minus sign (@code{/-}).  Within these begin and end comments, lines
beginning with a double slash (@code{//}) will be prefixed with a middle
comment (if the target language supports it).  These comments can appear
anywhere Output Comments can appear.

The following are two examples of a block comments:

@example

@node INCLUDE Statement
@section INCLUDE Statement
@cindex INCLUDE statement

The @code{INCLUDE} statement specifies that the contents of an external file
are to be incorporated in the OpenSDL input file directly following the
@code{INCLUDE} statement.  The @code{INCLUDE} statement has the following
syntax:

@example
INCLUDE "file-spec";
@end example
@cindex INCLUDE example

@strong{@code{"file-spec"}}
@indentedblock
Is any valid file specification enclosed in quotation marks (" ").  An
@code{INCLUDE} statement cannot appear embedded within an @code{AGGREGATE}
declaration, but can appear anywhere else within the module.  If a directory
is not included in the file specification, the current default directory is
used.
@end indentedblock
@cindex AGGREGATE keyword
@cindex INCLUDE statement

When OpenSDL encounters an @code{INCLUDE} statement, it stops reading from the
current file and reads the statements in the included file.  When it reaches
the end of the included file, OpenSDL resumes translation with the source
statement immediately following the @code{INCLUDE} statement.

@node Conditional OpenSDL Compilation

@cindex Conditional compilation

@subsection Conditional OpenSDL Compilation using the IFLANGUAGE statement

This feature allows a section of OpenSDL source code to be conditionally
compiled, depending on whether output is being generated for a particular
language or not.

The syntax for conditional compilation has the format:

@example
IFLANGUAGE language-name [ language-name ...  ] ;
    .
    .
    .
[ELSE ;
    .
    .
    .
]
END_IFLANGUAGE [ language-name [ language-name ...  ] ] ;
@end example
@cindex IFLANGUAGE statement
@cindex END_IFLANGUAGE statement
@cindex ELSE statemment

Note the following:

@itemize @bullet
@item The three keywords may appear wherever a statement is valid.

@item Conditional compilation statements may not be nested.

@item The list of language-names on the @code{END_IFLANGUAGE} is optional, but
if it is included, it must match the list on the @code{IFLANGUAGE} statement.
The languages need not necessarily appear in the same order.
@cindex IFLANGUAGE statement
@cindex END_IFLANGUAGE statement

@item Language names may not be abbreviated.

@item The validity of language names is not checked.  This is in keeping with
the philosophy of OpenSDL that new back ends may be added without changes to
the front end.

@item A comment on the same line as the @code{IFLANGUAGE} statement is only
output for languages which satisfy the condition.  A comment on the same line
as the @code{END_IFLANGUAGE} statement is always output, as this is considered
to be outside the body of the conditional.
@cindex IFLANGUAGE statement
@cindex END_IFLANGUAGE statement
@end itemize

In the following example, OpenSDL generates a translation of the ITEM statement
if output is being generated for Pascal, Ada, or FORTRAN.  For other languages,
OpenSDL does not generate a translation of the ITEM statement.

@example
IFLANGUAGE PASCAL ADA FORTRAN;

@subsection Conditional OpenSDL Compilation using the IFSYMBOL statement

This feature allows a section of OpenSDL source code to be conditionally
compiled, depending on symbols specified with the command line qualifier
@command{--symbol}.  The syntax for conditional compilation has the format:
@cindex Command line qualifiers

@example
IFSYMBOL symbol-name ;
    .
    .
    .
[ ELSE_IFSYMBOL symbol-name ;
    .

    .
]
END_IFSYMBOL ;
@end example
@cindex IFSYMBOL statement
@cindex ELSE_IFSYMBOL statement
@cindex END_IFSYMBOL statement
@cindex ELSE statemment

Note the following:
@itemize @bullet
@item The four keywords may appear wherever a statement is valid.
@item Conditional compilation statements may not be nested.
@item A comment on the same line as the @code{IFSYMBOL} statement is only
output if this symbol is specified on the command line.  A comment on the same
line as the @code{END_IFSYMBOL} statement is always output, as this is
considered to be outside the body of the conditional.
@cindex END_IFSYMBOL statement

@section Text Pass-through
@cindex Text pass-through

Text pass-through allows literal text to be passed through to the output
language file without translation.  It is normally used in conjunction with
conditional compilation for a specific target language.  The purpose is to
allow language-specific constructs, which cannot be represented in OpenSDL, to
be emitted.
@cindex Conditional compilation

The syntax for text pass-through is:

@example
LITERAL;
Any number of lines to be passed directly to
the output stream without translation
END_LITERAL;
@end example
@cindex END_LITERAL example
@cindex Text pass-through example

Note the following:
@itemize @bullet
@item The keywords @code{LITERAL} and @code{END_LITERAL} may appear wherever a
statement is valid.
@item The keyword @code{END_LITERAL} terminates a literal construct, and
therefore cannot be included in a line of literal text.  Any text preceding
@code{END_LITERAL} on the same line is output as a line of literal text.
@cindex END_LITERAL keyword
@end itemize

Literal text is processed identically in all back ends.  The literal text is
merely written directly to the output file.

The following is an example of text pass-through for the C/C++ language.

@example
IFLANGUAGE C
LITERAL
#define ctext "This appears in C language output only"
END_LITERAL
END_IFLANGUAGE C
@end example
@cindex END_LITERAL example
@cindex END_IFLANGUAGE example
@cindex IFLANGUAGE example
@cindex Text pass-through

Literal text within an @code{AGGREGATE} that contains a member definition, will
not be taking into account when calculating offsets.  It is recommended to use
conditional compilation @ref{Conditional OpenSDL Compilation} around text
pass-through and include a local variable @ref{Local Symbol Names} to account
for the added offset and then add this local variable when using the offset
after the text pass-through.  Also, do not forget to define the local variable
set to zero when the conditional code is not included, so that there an error
message will not be generated as the result of the missing variable.

@node DECLARE Statement
@section DECLARE Statement
@cindex DECLARE statement

The @code{DECLARE} statement allows you to declare a data item of a type that
you define, which may be unknown in the current OpenSDL compilation.  When you
use @code{DECLARE}, the type is made known when the target language source is
compiled.

The @code{DECLARE} statement uses the @code{SIZEOF} clause to allow you to
specify the size of the user-defined data type being declared.  The parameter
you specify in the @code{SIZEOF} clause may be a built-in OpenSDL data type, a
user-defined type defined in the current OpenSDL compilation, or an expression.
@cindex Data type, user defined
@cindex DECLARE SIZEOF clause

The @code{DECLARE} statement has the following syntax:

@example
DECLARE user-type SIZEOF @{ data-type @}     [ PREFIX prefix-string ]
                         @{ user-type @}     [ TAG tag-string ]
                         @{ ( expression ) @}
@end example

@strong{@code{user-type}}
@indentedblock
Represents the unknown data type name you wish to declare.
@end indentedblock

@strong{@code{SIZEOF}}
@indentedblock
A clause that must be appended to user-type.  The @code{SIZEOF} clause may be
specified in several ways, as shown, to indicate the size of the user-defined
type being declared.
@end indentedblock

@strong{@code{data-type}}
@indentedblock
Represents either a built-in OpenSDL data type, a user-defined type that is
known at OpenSDL compile time, or a data type that has been sized by a previous
@code{SIZEOF} clause.
@end indentedblock

@strong{@code{user-type}}
@indentedblock
Represents a user-defined data type.
@end indentedblock

@strong{@code{( expression )}}
@indentedblock
Represents an expression.  If specified, the expression must specify the number
of bytes to be reserved for this data type.  If the data type is dimensioned,
the @code{SIZEOF} clause must specify the size of a single element.  When you
specify an expression, always enclose it in parentheses, as shown in this
syntax.
@end indentedblock

Notes:
@enumerate
@item @code{DECLARE} identifies the size of the data type when included in an
@code{AGGREGATE} declaration.  (OpenSDL needs to know its equivalent predefined
type so that the correct default tag letter, if required, can be output.)
@cindex AGGREGATE keyword
@cindex Data type, user defined
@cindex DECLARE statement

@item You may declare a user-defined data type more than once (either
explicitly or implicitly), but any subsequent declaration must match the first.

@item The default tag letter for the unknown variable being sized is derived
from the type specified in the @code{SIZEOF} clause.  If you use an expression
in place of a data type to reserve a fixed number of bytes, the default tag
letter is @code{T}.  You may override the default tag by using an explicit TAG
option.
@cindex Data type, tag
@cindex TAG keyword

@item @code{SIZEOF} clauses cannot be nested.

@item You cannot qualify a reference to the name of a previously-declared
aggregate using the @code{SIZEOF} clause.
@cindex DECLARE SIZEOF clause

@item Although @code{DECLARE} statements and implicit @code{SIZEOF}
declarations appear in the output tree for use by the back ends, these do not
result in specific generated code.
@cindex DECLARE statement
@cindex DECLARE SIZEOF clause

@item Do not use the @code{SIZEOF} clause for data types that are aggregate
names.  Also, do not nest @code{SIZEOF} clauses where the syntax would
otherwise allow aggregate names.  For example, the following statements are
valid:

@example
DECLARE type SIZEOF ADDRESS (CHARACTER);
ITEM type ADDRESS (bar SIZEOF LONGWORD);
@end example
@cindex ADDRESS example
@cindex DECLARE example
@cindex DECLARE SIZEOF example

However, the following statement generates an error message:

@example
DECLARE type SIZEOF ADDRESS (bar SIZEOF LONGWORD);
@end example
@end enumerate

@subsubheading Examples

A database contains information on a number of forests in a region, each of
which contains a number of different types of trees.  The definition of the
tree structure is held in a different OpenSDL file from the other definitions.
When the second OpenSDL file is compiled, the composition of the tree structure
is unknown --- the definitions will only come together when the output files
are included in a compilation in the target language.  The following shows the
two OpenSDL files and the corresponding output in C/C++.

@heading MODULE Declaration
@cindex MODULE declaration

The following sections describe the function and format of a @code{MODULE}
declaration.

@section MODULE Description
@cindex MODULE description

A @code{MODULE} declaration groups all related symbols and data structures.
All declarations (other than local symbol assignments and local and output
comments) must occur within a module, which is delimited by the @code{MODULE}
and @code{END_MODULE} keywords.  An OpenSDL source file may contain multiple
@code{MODULE} declarations, but modules may not be nested.  You must specify a
module name on the @code{MODULE} declaration; this name corresponds to the name
of a macro or module in a given output language.  (@ref{Names} describes the
syntax for names.) For example:
@cindex Comments
@cindex Local comments
@cindex Output comments
@cindex Line comments
@cindex Block comments
@cindex Data structures
@cindex END_MODULE keyword
@cindex Local symbols
@cindex Local variables
@cindex MODULE declaration

@example
MODULE _modef;
@end example
@cindex MODULE example

This declaration generates the beginning of the declaration for the macro or
module named @code{_modef}.

You can use the @code{IDENT} option on a @code{MODULE} declaration to pass a
version number or other information that must be enclosed in quotation marks
(" ") to the output file.  For example:
@cindex IDENT keyword
@cindex MODULE keyword

@example
MODULE params IDENT "V2.0";
@end example
@cindex IDENT example
@cindex MODULE example

You can optionally specify the module name on the @code{END_MODULE} statement;
this is particularly useful if you place more than one @code{MODULE}
declaration in the same OpenSDL source file.  The module name is case-sensitive
and must match exactly (in case) the name specified on the @code{MODULE}
declaration.

The following sections describe the function and format of an @code{ITEM}
declaration.

@section ITEM Description
An @code{ITEM} declaration defines scalar items and single-dimensional arrays
of scalar items that are not members of aggregates.  You must specify an item
name and data type on the @code{ITEM} declaration.  For example:
@cindex Scalar items

@example
ITEM block_list_id WORD;
@end example

This declaration specifies the scalar item @code{block_list_id} of data type
@code{WORD}.

@node AGGREGATE Description
@section AGGREGATE Description
@cindex AGGREGATE keyword
@cindex AGGREGATE declaration

An @code{AGGREGATE} declaration defines nonscalar items and dimensional arrays

@subsection Subaggregate Declaration

Subaggregates are declared using the keyword @code{STRUCTURE} or @code{UNION}.
For example:

@float Example, Subaggregate Example
@example
AGGREGATE tree_node STRUCTURE;
    opcode WORD;
    lang_bits UNION;
        pli_bits STRUCTURE;
            resolved BITFIELD;
            psv BITFIELD;
            mark1 BITFIELD;
            spare_bits BITFIELD LENGTH 5;
        END pli_bits;
        c_bits STRUCTURE;
            value_variable_size BITFIELD;
            psv BITFIELD;
            expanded BITFIELD;
            resolved BITFIELD;
            reduced BITFIELD;
            spare_bits BITFIELD LENGTH 3;
        END c_bits;
    END lang_bits;
END tree_node;

In this example, the structures @code{pli_bits} and @code{c_bits} are both
subaggregates of the @code{union lang_bits}.  Because @code{lang_bits} is a
@code{union}, @code{c_bits} and @code{pli_bits} occupy the same storage.

The @code{COMMON}, @code{GLOBAL}, @code{BASED pointer-name}, and @code{ORIGIN}
options are invalid for a subaggregate.  All other @code{AGGREGATE} options are
valid.

@cindex BASED keyword
@cindex COMMON keyword
@cindex ORIGIN keyword
@cindex Subaggregate declaration

@subsection STRUCTURE Declaration

@code{STRUCTURE} declarations produce aggregate or subaggregate declarations
that are structures.  The members are not overlaid; each member has a unique
offset from the beginning of the structure, which means that members occupy
consecutive storage locations.
@cindex AGGREGATE member
@cindex Subaggregate declaration

The following shows the syntax of a first-level @code{STRUCTURE} declaration:

@example
AGGREGATE aggregate-name STRUCTURE [ options ];
@end example
@cindex AGGREGATE keyword

The following shows the syntax of a @code{STRUCTURE} declaration as an
aggregate member, that is, a subaggregate @code{STRUCTURE} declaration:
@cindex AGGREGATE member
@cindex Subaggregate declaration

@example
member-name STRUCTURE [ options ];
@end example

@subsection UNION Declaration

@code{UNION} declarations produce aggregate or subaggregate declarations that
are unions.  The first-level members are overlaid, which means that they occupy
the same storage location.
@cindex AGGREGATE member
@cindex UNION declaration
@cindex Subaggregate declaration

Each first-level member begins at the beginning of the union and, thus, has an
offset of zero.  A @code{UNION} declaration lets you represent the same storage
location using different names and different data types.

The following shows the syntax of a first-level @code{UNION} declaration:

@example
AGGREGATE aggregate-name UNION [ options ];
@end example
@cindex AGGREGATE keyword
@cindex UNION keyword

The following shows the syntax of a @code{UNION} declaration as an aggregate
member, that is, a subaggregate @code{UNION} declaration:
@cindex AGGREGATE member
@cindex UNION declaration
@cindex Subaggregate declaration

@example
member-name UNION [ options ]
@end example

@subsection Implicit Union Declarations

You may specify data types on an @code{AGGREGATE} declaration to cause the
@code{AGGREGATE} declaration to become an implicit union declaration.  An
implicit union declaration has these features:
@cindex AGGREGATE keyword
@cindex Implicit union declaration

@itemize @bullet
@item Gives OpenSDL the ability to detect subfield overflow without the need to 
define extraneous @code{STRUCTURE} and @code{UNION} declaration names.
@item Makes user-defined fill fields unnecessary.  This feature is most useful
for data structures containing substructures that are required to begin at
fixed offsets.
@end itemize
@cindex UNION data type
@cindex Data structures
@cindex Data type, UNION
@cindex Offsets

The following OpenSDL source code shows the syntax of an implicit union
(structure B defines the implicit union declaration):

@float Example, Implicit Union Example
@example
AGGREGATE A STRUCTURE;
    B STRUCTURE LONGWORD;
        bit_string1 BITFIELD LENGTH 1;
        bit_string2 BITFIELD LENGTH 4;
    END B;
    last_item WORD;
END A;
@end example
@caption{Implicit Union Example}
@end float
@cindex AGGREGATE example
@cindex BITFIELD example
@cindex END keyword
@cindex Implicit union example
@cindex LENGTH example

This implicit union declaration would be more cumbersome if represented as
shown in the following @code{STRUCTURE} subaggregate:

@example
AGGREGATE A STRUCTURE;
    X UNION ;
        B LONGWORD;
        Y STRUCTURE ;
            bit_string1 BITFIELD LENGTH 1;
            bit_string2 BITFIELD LENGTH 4;
        END Y;
    END X;
    last_item WORD;
END A;
@end example
@cindex AGGREGATE example
@cindex BITFIELD example
@cindex UNION example
@cindex END keyword
@cindex LENGTH example
@cindex Subaggregate example

In the previous example, the names @code{X} and @code{Y} become OpenSDL
generated filler names in the implicit union case.
@cindex Fillers

You do not have to define the union @code{X} and the structure @code{Y} if an
implicit union declaration is used.  By giving the structure @code{Y} a type,
OpenSDL creates a union of field @code{Y} with the specified type overlaid with
a structure containing the fields in @code{Y}.  In some language translations,
such as BLISS and MACRO, the OpenSDL-generated union and structure (@code{X}
and @code{Y} above) can be suppressed in the output because they are considered
extraneous fields.  In C, it is necessary to use the OpenSDL-generated union
and structure to generate the correct offsets within a structure.  Because the
union is of the length specified in the structure type, no filler is necessary
to ensure that subsequent fields (for example, last_item) are at the correct
offset.  If the fields of a structure extend past the size specified, OpenSDL
flags the overflow.  The C/C++ translation for the previous implicit union
declaration example is as follows:
@cindex Implicit union declaration
@cindex Offsets

@example
struct A
@{
    union B
    @{
        uint32_t bit_string1 : 1;
        uint32_t bit_string : 4;
    @};
    int16_t last_time;
@};
@end example
@cindex Implicit union example

The OpenSDL source file @file{/usr/lib/OpenSDL/examples/example.sdl} shows an
example of an implicit union declaration.

@subsection Implicit Union Declarations with the Optional @code{DIMENSION}
Keyword
@cindex Implicit union with DIMENSION keyword

The following is an example of an OpenSDL structure defined with a data type
and the @code{DIMENSION} keyword:
@cindex Implicit union declaration
@cindex DIMENSION keyword

@float Example, DIMENSION Example
@example
AGGREGATE fid STRUCTURE WORD DIMENSION 3;
    first WORD;
    second WORD;
    third WORD;
END fid;
@end example
@caption{DIMENSION Example}
@end float
@cindex AGGREGATE example
@cindex Implicit union example
@cindex DIMENSION example
@cindex END keyword

In the previous example, a single structure is overlaid by an array of elements
of the type specified by the structure type.

The fid structure is a three-word field that can be addressed as a single field
or by each individual word so that it is easily defined in OpenSDL as
represented above.  The following is the C/C++ translation for the OpenSDL
source code in the previous example:

@float Example, DIMENSION Output
@example
union fid[3]
@{
    int16_t first;
    int16_t second;
    int16_t third;
@};
@end example
@caption{DIMENSION Output}
@end float

The implicit union declaration allows structures to grow without the need to
modify any trailing fillers.  OpenSDL detects any overflow that may occur if
the structure grows past the size of its data type.  The size of the aggregate
(in bytes) is equal to the size of the data type (in bytes) multiplied by the
upper dimension (if any).  If the size of the aggregate is greater than the sum
of the size of all its members, OpenSDL still translates the declaration.
However, if the size of the members exceeds the size of the aggregate, OpenSDL
issues a message that has the following format:
@cindex AGGREGATE member
@cindex Implicit union declaration
@cindex Fillers

@code{%SDL-E-TOOMANYFIELDS, Structure fid has too many fields [Line ?]}
@cindex Implicit union declaration

@subsection Forcing Negative Offsets
@cindex Forcing negative offsets
@cindex Negative offsets
@cindex Offsets

The default origin of an aggregate is the beginning of the first aggregate
member.  You may specify the @code{ORIGIN} option on a level-1 @code{AGGREGATE}
declaration to indicate that the origin is located at the beginning of any
aggregate member.  The resulting declaration forces all aggregate members
declared before the specified origin to be located at negative offsets from the
origin.  For example:
@cindex AGGREGATE member

@float Example, ORIGIN Example
@example
AGGREGATE nodes STRUCTURE ORIGIN qflink;
    flink ADDRESS;
    blink ADDRESS;
    qflink ADDRESS;
    qblink ADDRESS;
END;
@end example
@caption{ORIGIN Example}
@end float
@cindex ADDRESS keyword
@cindex ADDRESS example
@cindex AGGREGATE keyword
@cindex AGGREGATE example
@cindex END keyword
@cindex ORIGIN example

This declaration defines the origin of the structure nodes to be at the member
@code{qflink}, so you may address @code{flink} and @code{blink} as negative
offsets from @code{qflink}.  Specifying an origin does not change the values of
the current bit and byte offset symbols (@code{^} and @code{:}).  These are
always calculated as being relative to the beginning of the aggregate.

@cindex Forcing data alignment

OpenSDL forces all @code{AGGREGATE} and subaggregate declarations to begin on
byte boundaries.  Thus, if an aggregate or subaggregate ends with
@code{BITFIELD} declarations that do not end on byte boundaries, OpenSDL
ensures that the next aggregate begins on a byte boundary by supplying
@code{BITFIELD} declarations as fillers, if necessary.
@cindex AGGREGATE keyword
@cindex BITFIELD keyword
@cindex Fillers
@cindex Subaggregate declaration

When OpenSDL adds @code{BITFIELD} declarations, it determines the length
required and provides a unique name of the form @code{string_V_FILL_n}.  The
string is the prefix supplied in the @code{AGGREGATE} declaration, or the
aggregate name if no prefix was supplied.  Within an aggregate, n begins at 0
and is incremented for each filler required.
@cindex AGGREGATE keyword
@cindex BITFIELD keyword

The subaggregate declarations shown in the following example declare filler
bitfields to force byte alignment at the end of each subaggregate; this
programming practice makes it unnecessary for OpenSDL to perform the alignment.

@node Using Offset Symbols
@subsection Using Offset Symbols

The period (@code{.}) represents the current byte offset from the origin in an
@code{AGGREGATE} declaration.  If the @code{ORIGIN} option is specified, the
value of the period is equal to the byte offset from the member specified using
the @code{ORIGIN} option.  The current byte offset is useful for capturing the
size of an aggregate or a portion of it.  For example, in the declaration of a
variable-length data structure, you can capture the size of the fixed-length
portion.
@cindex AGGREGATE keyword
@cindex AGGREGATE member
@cindex Byte offset symbols
@cindex Offsets

The colon (@code{:}) represents the current byte offset relative to the first
member in an @code{AGGREGATE} declaration.  The value is not affected by the
presence of an @code{ORIGIN} option.
@cindex AGGREGATE keyword
@cindex Byte offset symbols
@cindex ORIGIN keyword

The circumflex (@code{^}) represents the current bit offset relative to the
most recently declared aggregate or byte-aligned element.

The following example shows the use of the byte offset symbols.

In the previous example, the local symbol @code{#opsize} captures the byte
offset following the fixed length portion of the structure operator.  This
value is subsequently used in the @code{CONSTANT} declaration, which defines
the size of the constant portion of the structure in words.  The @code{flags}
structure is byte aligned by the field @code{filler}, which makes use of the
current bit offset symbol to compute the size of this field.  The
@code{CONSTANT inst_size} defines the size of the entire structure.

@heading CONSTANT Declaration

The following sections describe the function and format of a @code{CONSTANT}
declaration.

@section CONSTANT Description
A @code{CONSTANT} declaration generates a list of one or more named constants
in the output file.  You may specify a valid constant name or names and the
constant values to be assigned to them.  For example:
@cindex CONSTANT keyword
@cindex CONSTANT declaration
@cindex CONSTANT description
@cindex Named constants

@example
CONSTANT block_node_size EQUALS 24;

CONSTANT Strcon EQUALS STRING "This is a string constant" PREFIX Jg_;
@end example
@cindex CONSTANT example
@cindex EQUALS example
@cindex EQUALS STRING example
@cindex PREFIX example

The first declaration creates the named constant @code{block_node_size} and
assigns it the value 24.  The second declaration creates the named string
constant @code{Jg_K_Strcon} and assigns it the specified value.
@cindex Named constants

The values of both declared constants (except string constants) and local
symbols may be used in OpenSDL expressions.  However, there is an important
difference between declared constants and local symbols: declared constants are
translated directly to the output file, whereas local symbols are not passed
directly to the output file.  For example, you can define the local symbol
@code{#block_size} as follows:
@cindex Local symbols

@example
#block_size = 24;
@end example
@cindex Expressions

A subsequent @code{CONSTANT} declaration may refer to @code{#block_size} and
use the value 24, as follows:

@example
CONSTANT block_node_size EQUALS #block_size;
@end example
@cindex CONSTANT example
@cindex EQUALS example

@code{CONSTANT} declarations (except string constants) can also be specified in
a comma-delimited list, as follows:
@cindex CONSTANT declaration
@cindex EQUALS example
@cindex EQUALS keyword

@example
CONSTANT
    xyz EQUALS 10,
    alpha EQUALS 0,
    noname EQUALS 63;
@end example

To specify related constants with the same or incremental values, use a
@code{CONSTANT} declaration with the @code{INCREMENT} option.  In this form,
the @code{EQUALS} expression gives the value to be assigned to the first named
constant; values for subsequent constants are derived by incrementing the first
value by the specified increment and assigning the result to the next name in
the list.  For example:

@example
CONSTANT (
    bits,
    bytes,
    words,
    longs,
    quads,
    octas
    ) EQUALS 0 INCREMENT 1 PREFIX ctx_;
@end example
@cindex CONSTANT example
@cindex EQUALS example
@cindex INCREMENT example
@cindex Named constant example
@cindex PREFIX example

When OpenSDL assigns incremental values, it loops until values are assigned to
all the names in a list.  If there is no @code{INCREMENT} clause, the increment
value is 0; thus, the same initial value is assigned to all the names.  If
names are omitted from a comma-delimited list, OpenSDL reserves the numbers
that would be assigned to names in those positions.  This lets you reserve
numeric values for later assignment of names.  For example:
@cindex INCREMENT keyword
@cindex Numeric values

@example
CONSTANT
    (bad_block,bad_data,,,,
     overlay,rewrite) EQUALS 0 INCREMENT 4;
@end example
@cindex CONSTANT keyword
@cindex EQUALS keyword
@cindex INCREMENT keyword

In the previous example, OpenSDL assigns the values 0 and 4 to the names
@code{bad_block} and @code{bad_data}, reserves the values 8, 12, and 16, and
assigns the values 20 and 24 to the names @code{overlay} and @code{rewrite},
respectively.

The @code{COUNTER} option saves the last assigned value in a specified local
symbol for subsequent use.  For example:
@cindex COUNTER option
@cindex Local symbols

@example
CONSTANT (pli,c,bliss,macro)
    EQUALS 4 INCREMENT 4 PREFIX lang_
    COUNTER #lang;

CONSTANT (basic,pascal,fortran)
    EQUALS #lang + 4 INCREMENT 4 PREFIX lang_;
